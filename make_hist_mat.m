% This code will request the following requirements.
% 1.Your computer install libsvm
% (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) and it's matlab wrapper.
% 2.Your target feature representation text must be alined together for
% each class and the class number should be the order.

% Please type the "file_name" the scaled feature representation libsvm format text
% file name.
% And type freely the file name of the ".mat" format you want to save to
% "save_name".
% Please check and type the number of classification class of your target
% dataset.
